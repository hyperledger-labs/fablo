Fabrica supports:

* Environment: Docker
* RAFT and solo consensus protocols
* Multiple organizations and channels
* Chaincode installation and upgrade

## Installation

Fabrica is distributed as a single shell script which uses Docker image to generate the network config.
You may keep the script in the root directory of your project or install it globally in your file system.

To install it globally:

```bash
sudo curl -Lf https://github.com/softwaremill/fabrica/releases/download/0.0.1/fabrica.sh -o /usr/local/bin/fabrica && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fabrica
```

To get a copy of Fabrica for a single project, execute in the project root:

```bash
curl -Lf https://github.com/softwaremill/fabrica/releases/download/0.0.1/fabrica.sh -o ./fabrica.sh
```

## Basic usage

```bash
fabrica.sh up /path/to/fabrica-config.json
```

The `up` command creates initial configuration and starts Hyperledger Fabric network on Docker.
In this case network configuration is saved in `$(pwd)/fabrica-target`.
Then you can manage the network with other commands, for example `stop`, `start`, `down`, `prune`.

Provided Fabrica configuration file describes network topology: root organization, other organizations, channels and chaincodes.
See the [samples](https://github.com/softwaremill/fabrica/blob/main/samples/) or [Fabrica config](https://github.com/softwaremill/fabrica#fabrica-config) section.

There are two basic use cases.
You may use Fabrica to start and manage the network for development purposes, test different network topologies, run it in CI environment etc.
In this case you should keep `fabrika-target` directory intact and out of the version control.
Fabrica will manage it locally.

On the other hand you can use Fabrica to generate initial network configuration, keep it in version control and tweak for specific requirements.
In this case, however, you should use generated `fabrica-docker.sh` instead of `fabrica` script.

## Managing the network

### init

```bash
fabrica init
```

Creates simple network config file in current dir.
Good step to start your adventure with Fabrica or set up a fast prototype. 

### generate

```bash
fabrica generate [/path/to/fabrica-config.json [/path/to/fabrica/target]]
```

Generates network configuration files in the given directory.
Default config file path is `$(pwd)/fabrica-config.json`, default directory is `$(pwd)/fabrica-target`.
If you specify a different directory, you loose Fabrica support for other commands.

If you want to use Fabrica only to kick off the Hyperledger Fabric network, you may provide target directory parameter or just copy generated Fabrica target directory content to desired directory and add it to version control.
Note that generated files may contain variables with paths on your disk and generated crypto material for Hyperledger Fabric.
Review the files before submitting to version control system.

### up

```bash
fabrica up [/path/to/fabrica-config.json]
```

Starts the Hyperledger Fabric network for given Fabrica configuration file, creates channels, installs and instantiates chaincodes.
If there is no configuration, it will call `generate` command for given config file.

### down, start, stop

```bash
fabrica [down | start | stop]
```

Downs, starts or stops the Hyperledger Fabric network for configuration in the current directory.
This is similar to down, start and stop commands for Docker Compose.

### prune

```bash
fabrica prune
```

Downs the network and removes `fabrica-target` directory.

### validate

```bash
fabrica validate [/path/to/fabrica-config.json]
```

Validates network config. This command will validate your network config try to suggest necessary changes or additional tweaks.
Please note that this step is also executed automatically before each `generate` to ensure that at least critical errors where fixed. 

### fabric-docker.sh

The script `fabric-docker.sh` is generated among docker network configuration.
It does not support `generate` command, however other commands work in same way as in `fabrica.sh`.
Basically `fabrica.sh` forwards commands other than `generate` to this script.
In most cases you can use `fabrica.sh docker` and `fabric-docker.sh` interchangebly.

## Managing chaincodes

### chaincode upgrade

```bash
fabrica chaincode upgrade chaincode-name version
```

Upgrades and instantiates chaincode with given name on all relevant peers.
Chaincode directory is specified in Fabrica config file.

## Utility commands

### version

```bash
fabrica version [--verbose | -v]
```
Prints current Fabrica version.
With optional `-v` or `--verbose` flag it prints supported Fabrica and Hyperledger Fabric versions as well.

### use

```bash
fabrica use
```   

Lists all available Fabrica versions.

### use <version-number>

```bash
fabrica use <version-number>
```   

Switches current script to selected version.

## Fabrica config

Fabrica config is a single JSON file that describes desired Hyperledger Fabric network topology (network settings, CA, orderer, organizations, peers, channels, chaincodes).
It has to be compatible with the [schema].
You may generate a basic config with `./fabrica.sh init` command.
See the [samples](https://github.com/softwaremill/fabrica/blob/main/samples/) directory for more complex examples.

The basic structure of Fabrica config file is as follows:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/softwaremill/fabrica/releases/download/0.0.1/schema.json",
  "networkSettings": { ... },
  "rootOrg": { ... },
  "orgs": [ ... ],
  "channels": [ ... ],
  "chaincodes": [ ... ]
}
```

### networkSettings

Example:

```json
  "networkSettings": {
    "fabricVersion": "1.4.6",
    "tls": false,
    "loglevel": "debug"
  },
```

### rootOrg

Example:

```json
  "rootOrg": {
    "organization": {
      "key": "root",
      "name": "Orderer",
      "mspName": "OrdererMSP",
      "domain": "root.com"
    },
    "ca": {
      "prefix": "ca"
    },
    "orderer": {
      "prefix": "orderer",
      "type": "raft",
      "instances": 3
    }
  },
```

### orgs

Example:

```json
  "orgs": [
    {
      "organization": {
        "key": "org1",
        "name": "Org1",
        "mspName": "Org1MSP",
        "domain": "org1.com"
      },
      "ca": {
        "prefix": "ca"
      },
      "peer": {
        "prefix": "peer",
        "instances": 2,
        "db": "LevelDb"
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
```

### channels

Example:

```json
  "channels": [
    {
      "key": "channel1",
      "name": "my-channel1",
      "orgs": [
        {
          "key": "org1",
          "peers": [
            "peer0"
          ]
        },
        {
          "key": "org2",
          "peers": [
            "peer0"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
```

### chaincodes

Example:

```json
  "chaincodes": [
    {
      "name": "chaincode1",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "lang": "node",
      "channel": "channel2",
      "init": "{\"Args\":[]}",
      "endorsement": "OR ('Org1MSP.member', 'Org2MSP.member')",
      "directory": "./chaincodes/chaincode-kv-node"
    },
    {
      "name": "chaincode2",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "lang": "java",
      "channel": "channel2",
      "init": "{\"Args\":[]}",
      "endorsement": "OR ('Org1MSP.member', 'Org2MSP.member')",
      "directory": "./chaincodes/chaincode-java-simple"
    }
  ]
```
